    bio: "Cameron lived or worked abroad for much of his career. After graduating from Yale and MIT's Sloan School, he and his wife, Seymour, moved to Colombia on their wedding day, where he spent two years as an MIT Fellow in a steel company. Then their growing family lived in Canada, Guatemala, Thailand and the Netherlands ___ where he worked in marketing and general management for Warner-Lambert Co., a consumer products and pharmaceutical company. After moving back to the Boston area, Cameron's career as a consultant took him to many other countries, mostly developing ones. Most work was in small business development and information technology management in the insurance field. After retirement in 1996, Cameron started volunteering almost full time in Rockport. He started as a teacher's assistant in information technology classes and then began fundraising; now he's the president of the Educational Foundation for Rockport. One project is to use local contacts to bring undergraduate volunteers into Rockport classrooms. Besides volunteering, Cameron and Seymour enjoy aquatic activities such as sailing, kayaking, and keeping their small grandchildren from eating too much seaweed.",

    bio: "I grew up in Lexington, MA, graduated from Lexington High School, and spent a year with a family in Zurich through the American Field Service before attending Radcliffe College. At Radcliffe, I majored in Biochemical Sciences because of a wonderful experimental course on genetics I had in high school. I gravitated toward neuroscience and then cognitive development as I realized I was more interested in the programs behind our thinking than in the hardware through which it is done. At Radcliffe, I met my husband, Doug (also a member of HILR), who was a year ahead of me at Harvard. We were married right after I finished college and we moved to New York City together for graduate school. I received my PhD from Columbia University in Experimental Psychology and landed my first job teaching Developmental and Cognitive Psychology at New York University. NYU promoted me to Associate Professor, but did not grant me tenure. Meanwhile, Doug received his law degree from Columbia Law School, worked at a Wall Street firm, and then served as an Assistant US Attorney in the Eastern District of New York. We moved back to the Boston Area, and I was hired by the Wellesley College Psychology Department as an Adjunct Associate Professor. I continued to teach there part-time for twenty years, while also conducting longitudinal studies of epistemological development from preschool through middle school and over the college years. I then joined Wellesley's Office of Institutional Research full-time as a research analyst. I worked in OIR for the next fifteen years until my retirement. When I first moved from teaching with research on the side to solely research, I missed teaching, but that faded. I loved having a job in which I interacted with people at all levels across the college and in which I could find and follow patterns in data that might enable the College to improve. Our two sons are now in their 30's and married. Greg is a lawyer with The Hartford insurance company and Rick is an Assistant Professor of Economics at Cornell University. Now that I have retired, I'm looking forward to reading, learning, traveling, visiting with our two grandchildren (and more to come, I hope), and getting back to exercise, tango, tennis, and skiing.",
