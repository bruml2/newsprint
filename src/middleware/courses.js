    "title": "Buddhism, An Ancient Religion Growing in the US",
    "day": "Monday",
    "time": "morning",
    "duration": "full",
    "catDescr": "What is there about Buddhism that has inspired devotees over the ages and led it to become America’s fourth-largest religion? Is it controlling one’s own actions and mental states, fellowship and personal psychic benefits, or its being a major religion that does not postulate divine intervention? American growth has come almost entirely since 1900, with more than four million adherents today. We will explore Buddhism’s birth in India, its core elements, comparison to other world religions founded in the fertile 1000-400 BCE period, evolution from a way of life to a religion, peaceful adaptation as it spread from India to elsewhere in East Asia, and its leap to the US. Focus will be “from the outside in,” examining history, principal teachings, scriptures and devotional and ethical practices, balancing lecture and discussion. We will use an introductory text, materials on the religion’s forebears, and a visit by a Zen meditation adept. Estimated outside work is two hours per week. Class size is limited to 25.",

    "title": "Current Challenges in American Higher Education",
    "day": "Monday",
    "time": "afternoon",
    "duration": "full",
    "catDescr": "Critics claim that American colleges and universities are unnecessarily expensive; are hostile to conservative views; increase rather than decrease inequality; coddle rather than challenge students; and allow too many to graduate without gaining much knowledge, skill, or wisdom. As more students attend college, many with inadequate high school preparation, and states reduce their funding for public institutions, schools are being squeezed. STEM fields are emphasized at the expense of liberal arts, and proponents of new technologies claim that traditional bricks-and-mortar colleges will soon be obsolete. We will examine the validity of the criticisms and explore how our institutions of higher education might be strengthened across their diversity in size, selectivity, and mission. We will read and discuss a recent book by two economics professors, articles on how experiences in and out of the classroom are affected by a student’s background, and evidence for what best promotes intellectual and personal growth. Estimated outside work is three hours per week. Class size is limited to 20.",
